Data Transformation Steps
-------------------------

1. For each of the training and test datasets, 
  * Read the data
  * Take a subset of the columns representing only the mean and standard deviation values. This is done via regular expressions. Only variables with the terms `-mean()` and `-std()` in it are used, variables with term  `meanFreq()` in it are excluded
  * Associate additional columns to represent activities and subject IDs read from `y_<dataset>.txt` and `subject_<dataset>.txt` files respectively
  * Assign column names by manipulating the measurement names in features.txt to remove spaces and convert them to camel case
2. Merge the training and the test sets, read as in step 1 to create one data set
3. Associate an additional column with descriptive activity names as specified in `activity_labels.txt`
4. Use `ddply` of the package `plyr` to get a data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
5. Save the result in re-casted dataset as `dataSet_MeanValues.txt`


Variable Descriptions
-------------------------

The data for this data set was derived from sources mentioned in the "Original data" section of this document. Part of the description below has been taken from the original data description.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern: '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

  * mean: Mean value
  * std: Standard deviation
